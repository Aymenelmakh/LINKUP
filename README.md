# LINKUP
LinkUp is a front-end social media web application that allows users to authenticate, view profiles, create and manage posts, and interact through comments. It consumes a RESTful API, supports user-specific actions (update/delete posts), includes loaders for async requests, and features dark mode for an improved user experience.
